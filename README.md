# Paper Monitor

[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md)

Paper Monitor is a local desktop monitor for newly published research papers. The current build focuses on solid-state battery literature and combines journal-scoped Crossref/RSS retrieval, local deduplication, keyword analysis, and a native macOS menu bar app.

The app runs locally. It does not require an LLM service, and OpenAlex is disabled by default.

## Features

- Native macOS menu bar app with manual refresh, settings, dashboard access, and notification testing.
- Local notifications for newly matched papers.
- Crossref and RSS retrieval with journal scope controls.
- Local SQLite deduplication so repeated papers are not notified again.
- HTML dashboard grouped by detected date, with sorting by time, impact factor, and relevance.
- Keyword analysis with date range, journal scope, candidate term filtering, block terms, taxonomy editing, and compact analysis paper list.
- Configurable search terms, excluded terms, journal scope, refresh interval, and Top N journal selection.
- Journal metric metadata from `journal_metrics.json`.
- Early Windows tray source is included for contributors, but the published binary release is currently macOS only.

## Download

Download the latest macOS build from the GitHub Releases page.

After extracting the ZIP, move `Paper Monitor.app` to `Applications` or `$HOME/Applications`, then open it. The build is ad-hoc signed for local distribution, so macOS may ask you to confirm the first launch from System Settings or by right-clicking the app and choosing Open.

## Build From Source

Requirements:

- macOS with Xcode command line tools
- Swift Package Manager
- Python 3

Run the Python test suite:

```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

Run the native macOS tests:

```bash
cd macos/PaperMonitorApp
swift test
```

Build the macOS app:

```bash
scripts/build_macos_app.sh
```

The built app is written to:

```text
dist/Paper Monitor.app
```

## Configuration

The app bundles `config.example.json` and creates a user-writable runtime copy on first launch. Runtime files are stored under:

```text
$HOME/Library/Application Support/PaperMonitor
```

Useful settings include:

- `interval_seconds`: refresh interval while the app is running.
- `max_notifications`: maximum notifications sent per refresh.
- `journal_scope.top_n`: default Top N journal scope.
- `journal_scope.selected_journals`: manually selected journals.
- `include_terms`: search and matching terms.
- `exclude_terms`: terms used to suppress irrelevant matches.
- `sources.crossref`: Crossref retrieval settings.

The personal `config.json`, runtime database, logs, and Crossref cache are intentionally excluded from this repository.

## Privacy

Paper Monitor stores runtime data locally. It does not upload your reading history or matched papers to a server. Crossref/RSS requests are made directly from your machine to the configured data sources.
